Introduction
==============================================================================

colemaktutor helps you to learn and practise typing in the colemak
layout (and qwerty layout).

**Try out the Colemak layout without fiddling with your Operating System**

Emulate a layout so you can learn and practice typing in colemak without
the need for installing an implementation for your operating system.
It's a command line program only, but colemaktutor is designed to
optionally support more interfaces in the future.
